# MexRest
This is a website design for a fictional Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn, NY named El Perro Negro.  I first started coding it using only HTML5 and CSS3 but later switched to the Bootstrap framework and reworked the site.  Final project for Skilled Up Academy's Intro to Front End Web Development. Features responsive design.
